4. Thought: Determine if you need more actions or can provide final answer
5. Final Answer: Provide comprehensive response to user with the content of reference source or sample data

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- For visualization requests, FIRST get data using sql_agent, THEN use plotting_agent
- If an agent fails, explain why and suggest alternatives
- Don't make assumptions about data - verify with appropriate agents
